# processing_sketches

This collection of sketches mostly was created by me, but not entirely. Attribution is not given on a sketch-by-sketch basis (yet). Feel free to clone and play with the sketches here, but don't make the assumption the code is yours to take and use. If you have questions about who created a specific sketch, please post in the GitHub Issues.
